					Hello! My name is Alena, I'm an IT student in Poland looking for an internship. I studied software engineering in Russian Technological University for 2,5 years prior to going to Collegium Da Vinci in Poznań where I'm studying now. My studies are conducted in English so I speak the language fluently. I know the basics of several programming languages such as Python, C++, C# and Java, I've made projects using them. Besides that, I know the basics of SQL, I've made one-page websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I love learning new things, analysing data and using my brain to come up with solutions, that's why I chose to study IT. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to get working experience in IT just yet, however I worked at a Center of culture "Avangard" in Moscow as a manager where I had to deal with people a lot and it let me develop communication and teamwork-related skills.
					I have a study visa which ends on 31.08.2022, however I'm planning on applying for karta pobytu and I really want to stay and work in Poland long-term.
